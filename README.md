# The Hacking Project - Database of a Moocs Website


## :mag: The content
In these exercises, I had to design a **database** for a **Hacker News-like message board** where:
* Users can post links. 
* Other users can comment on submitted links, or comment on comments.

**After cloning the repository, make sure to do :**
```sh
$ cd thp_make-db-moocademy
$ bundle install
```

This will install all the dependencies needed for the exercises.
